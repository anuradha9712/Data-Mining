DATA-ANALYSIS OF CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN IN INDIA


The aim of the project is to analyze the trends of crimes against women across various states and union territories over a twelve year period of 2001-12. 
The project strives to uncover if there is has been any secular rise or fall or whether there is some other discernible pattern in the crime rates.
At the same time, efforts will be made to identify what underlies such patterns.
